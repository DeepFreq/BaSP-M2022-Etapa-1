# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 2022 - Second Weekly Problem.

Hello! This is my second project done for RR in this second weekly problem.

â™¦ In this second week of testing, I have made an HTML structure of a landing page that we have designed in Figma.

## Description of the project.

In this HTML structure, it has been built in a basic, simple way, but with the substantial elements to be considered a good basic HTML structure.
This work has been carried out with the aim of laying the foundations to subsequently build a more complex HTML base and the addition of technologies such as CSS and Javascript.

### This structure contains the following data within it:

- Title
- Home
- Sing In
- Log In
- Contact
- Phone
- Address
- Article
- Features
- Record of Hours
- Resource Management
- Reports
- Multiple Roles
- Best Skills
- Information
- History
- Other web pages
- Footer
