# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 2022 - Second Weekly Problem.

Hello! This is my second project done for RR in this second weekly problem.

♦ In this second week of testing, I have made an HTML structure of a landing page that we have designed in Figma.

## Description of the project.

In this HTML structure, it has been built in a basic, simple way, but with the substantial elements to be considered a good basic HTML structure.
This work has been carried out with the aim of laying the foundations to subsequently build a more complex HTML base and the addition of technologies such as CSS and Javascript.

### This structure contains the following data within it:

- Title
- Home
- Sing In
- Log In
- Contact
- Phone
- Address
- Article
- Features
- Record of Hours
- Resource Management
- Reports
- Multiple Roles

# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 2022 - Third Weekly Problem.

Hello! This is my third project done for RR in this third weekly problem.

♦ In this third week our goal has been to implement CSS in our HTML.

## Description of the project.
In this third week our goal has been to implement CSS in our HTML. Our goal was to achieve an exact or close resemblance to the Figma layout, strictly using -position- to position objects and -NOT- using -flexbox-. The learning consisted in being able to understand the use of CSS attributes before -flexbox- appeared.

♦ In this fourth weekly issue, we continue with CSS by implementing -flexbox-.

## Description of the project.
In this fourth week we begin to implement -flexbox- in our jobs. We thoroughly study its uses and implementations, making CSS work more agile, fast and flexible.
We also implement the use of -media queries- for 3 different resolutions, 3 devices: Mobile, Tablet and desktop.
